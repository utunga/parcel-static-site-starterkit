### How to use 🧐

`Make sure you have node installed. If not, I recommend installing via` [nvm(Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

1- Put your code in `src` folder

> There are sample files already present (feel free to delete them and add yours) to give you an idea about the architecture. You only to care about just one file i.e, `index.html`. You need to put at the `src` (`src/index.html`) folder level.

2- Install necessary packages - `npm i` or `yarn`

3- Run project (Development) - `npm run start` or `yarn run start`

4- Build(If you ready to deploy) - `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

5- Build_Docs(to get it ready to push to github pages)
   - update the CNAME file to have your domain name (just the domain name without www or https or http)
   - setup your repo on github  to serve 'docs' and expect CNAME
   - `npm run build_docs`
   - git commit the docs dir and git push 

### Commands available 🛠:

There are only three commands

1- `npm run start` - It starts a local server so that you can work on your project without any hustle. Enjoy Hot reloading (Live Updates in browser) and SASS/SCSS support.

2- `npm run build` - When you are ready to deploy. You can build your project and deploy the `dist` folder made by this command.

3- `npm run reset` - It just cleans `dist` (output folder) and `.cache` folder. Run this command before starting work on a new project. Parcel caches some files for the faster builds so its good to remove them before switching project.

### Advanced 👽

1- `.browserslistrc` - Default configuration targets IE-10 as well. If you don't want to support IE then you can delete configuration from this. Read more [here](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#browserslist-)

2- `.postcssrc` - This file is responsible to manage PostCSS plugin. This file can configure CSS plugins like AutoPrefixer, CSS Modules etc. Read more [here](https://parceljs.org/css.html#postcss)

3- Everything- This project has been built on top of [Parcel](https://parceljs.org). You can configure completely as you want.
